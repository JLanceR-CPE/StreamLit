# Fruit Classifier Application
This application predicts the different kinds of fruits that I set based on the dataset that I have. The fruits in the dataset are apple fruit, banana fruit, cherry fruit, chickoo fruit, grape fruit, kiwi fruit, mango fruit, orange fruit, and strawberry fruit. The accuracy of this model is only 49%. Some of the photos that you will put up will not display accurately because the model is confusing based on the color and shape of the fruits. Like, the mango and banana fruit, the kiwi and chickoo fruit, and the cherry and strawberry fruit.
